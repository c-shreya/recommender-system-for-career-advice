# recommender-system-for-career-advice
A recommender system that would enable users to answer relevant questions based on their interests on CareerVillage.org

Recommender systems are widely used in online services ranging from recommending entertainment media such as music and movies, to suggestions on what products to purchase, to even establishing communication channels with other individuals online.

In this project, we shall put to use recommender systems to better enable better enable a career advising company CareerVillage.org to recommend relevant career advisers to relevant students based on the questions asked. The website currently faces two big challenges that we are required to address - (a) Very few professionals continue to answer questions in their lifetime at CareerVillage, and (b) There is a large time lag between a question being posed and it being answered. These tasks are particularly challenging, since we cannot apply conventional recommender system techniques directly given the data we have.
